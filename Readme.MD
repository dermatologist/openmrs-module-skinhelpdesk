## What is openMRS?

openMRS is a highly customizable EMR platform that can be extended and customized by user-contributed modules. More details here: [http://openmrs.org](http://openmrs.org)

## What is openmrs-module-skinhelpdesk?

This is a module for dermatologists to doodle lesions on a body image during consultations, a typical workflow pattern for us. The theortical basis for LesionMapper is pending publication. Read an informal introduction on my blog [NuChange.ca](http://nuchange.ca/2014/08/lesionmapper-pictographic-lesion-encoder-for-dermatology.html)

## What is the motivation?

This is a learning project for me to understand the nuances of the new openmrs ui framework. This project may be useful for other newbies like me as well. I have ported the interface I created for my patient portal [http://skinhelpdesk.com](http://skinhelpdesk.com) to openMRS. 

## How do I use this as a openMRS 2.x module learning project?

I have added my notes to the docs folder. The openMRS wiki is a good reference. I will add a step by step instruction manual in the [prodents wiki](http://wiki.prodents.com). Join us on our ##ehealth IRC channel or [PRO{DENTS}](http://prodents.com) events.

## How do I install and use this module?
- [Download latest release](https://github.com/dermatologist/openmrs-module-skinhelpdesk/releases). Upload omod to OpenMRS.
